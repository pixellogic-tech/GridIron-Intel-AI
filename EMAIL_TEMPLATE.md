### **Part 2: Feature Deep Dive Path**

**(If the caller chooses "Tell me about your features")**

"Great. Gridiron Intel is a comprehensive platform designed to save coaches time, accelerate player development, and provide a significant tactical advantage. We offer dedicated tools for coaches, players, and program administrators.

#### **Path 2a: Tools for Coaches**

"Our Coach Dashboard is the command center for your program. We empower coaches to:

*   **Automate Film Breakdown:** Our AI analyzes game film in minutes, not hours. This saves our partner schools an average of ten hours per week.
*   **Generate Instant Scouting Reports:** Our AI generates professional-grade scouting reports, detailing opponent tendencies and exploitable weaknesses.
*   **Predict Plays in Real-Time:** During a game, our Live Play Predictor uses the current game state to predict the opponent's next move with a precise confidence score.
*   **Create Plays On-Demand:** With our Quick Tactic Generator, you can input any tactical situation and the AI will instantly generate a full play explanation *and* a professional play diagram.
*   **And finally, we have a full suite of advanced tools,** including a visual playbook creator, an AI telestrator for film sessions, and a video drill generator.

Would you like to hear about the Player Portal, or are you ready to schedule a demo?"

---

#### **Path 2b: The Player Portal**

"We believe player development is key. Every player on your roster gets their own secure portal, which includes:

*   **A Personalized Game Plan:** Players receive the team scouting report, plus a unique positional briefing from the AI, telling them exactly what to focus on.
*   **An AI Play Analyst:** For any play, a player can ask the AI to break down their specific responsibilities—what to read, what their assignment is, and common mistakes to avoid.
*   **A Private AI Coach Chat:** Players have 24/7 access to a private chat with an AI coach that is primed with their stats and position, ready to provide personalized advice.
*   **And, of course, a full suite of tools for goal setting and uploading their own film for review.**

This level of engagement keeps your players locked in and accelerates their football I.Q.

Would you like to hear about the Coach's tools, or are you ready to schedule a demo?"

---

#### **Path 2c: The Highlights**

"Gridiron Intel is the ultimate competitive advantage. We save coaching staffs over 10 hours a week by **automating film breakdown and scouting report generation.** We give you a sideline advantage with a **real-time AI play predictor.** And we accelerate player growth with **personalized player portals,** featuring an AI coach that breaks down individual assignments for every play.

It is the most advanced, all-in-one football intelligence platform on the market.

Would you like to hear more details, or shall we schedule a demo so you can see it in action?"

### **Part 3: Pricing Information Path**

**(If the caller chooses "I'd like pricing information")**

"We offer simple, transparent pricing for the entire season. Our packages are designed to fit any program's needs.

*   Our **Varsity** plan includes all our essential tools, including AI film breakdowns and player portals for one team.
*   Our **Pro** plan is our most popular, adding advanced features like predictive play suggestions and auto-generated highlight reels.

### **Part 4: Schedule a Demo Path**

**(If the caller chooses "Schedule a demo" or is funneled here from another path)**

"Excellent. A live, on-site demo is the best way to see the power of Gridiron Intel firsthand. We bring the platform directly to your campus to show your entire coaching staff how it works.

To get started, I'll need to collect some information so a member of our team can reach out to you personally to schedule a convenient time.

After the tone, please say and spell out your full name, the name of your school, and the best email address to reach you. If you'd also like to leave a phone number, you can do so after providing your email. I'll confirm the details with you once you're done. Please begin speaking after the tone."

**(System pauses for voice input, then ideally has a confirmation step)**

"Thank you. Just to confirm, I have... [AI repeats collected information: Name, School, Email, Phone Number]. Is that correct?"

**(If 'Yes'):** "Perfect. A Gridiron Intel representative will be in touch within one business day to schedule your on-site demo. We look forward to speaking with you. Have a great day."
